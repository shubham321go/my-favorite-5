<h1> I love coding</h1>
<p>
I love coding because there are infinte possibilites. From coding I can make a website, I can make a game, I can make animations.So that's why I love Coding.Coding is important to learn because computer programming teaches children to experiment and gives them the confidence to be creative. They will have the chance to design something that is entirely their own. Children thrive off of the feedback they get from creating something they love.</p>
